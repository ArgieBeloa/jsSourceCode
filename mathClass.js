   Math = an intrinics object that provides basic mathematics functionality and constants.

let x = 9
let y = 10
let z = 11
let minimum
let maximum

// now let`S round off this x variable using math.

//x = Math.round(x)
//x = Math.floor(x) for round down
//x = Math.ceil(x) for round up
//x = Math.pow(b,e) where b = base and e = exponent
//x = Math.sqrt(x) the square root  x is _____
//x = Math.abs(x) the value of x is distance from 0 simple removing the negative sign
//maximum = Math.max(x, y, z) simple know the largest number of them all 
//minimum = Math.min(x, y, z) simple know the lowest number of them all 
x = Math.PI

console.log(x)
